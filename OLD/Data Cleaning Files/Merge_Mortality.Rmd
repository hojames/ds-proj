# information on IHME Mortality Data:
IHME research applied a novel methodology to death registration data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) in order to estimate annual county-level mortality rates for 21 mutually exclusive causes of death. This dataset provides estimates for cause-specific age-standardized mortality rates at the county level for each state, the District of Columbia, and the United States as a whole for 1980-2014 (quinquennial), as well as the changes in rates during this period.


Add Zero's to FISP codes less than 6 numbers so we can merge dataframes easily by FISP 
```{r}
#add leading zeros
library(stringr)
AllMortality$FIPS <- str_pad(AllMortality$FIPS, width=5, side="left", pad="0")
```
Save Mortality Table
```{r}
save(AllMortality, file="AllMortality.Rda")
```
