# Understanding Recent Declines in Life Expectancy in the United States 
---
## Motivation
We are interested in exploring domestic health policy through the lens of county-level health rankings, mortality data, and other relevant determinants of health. Across the United States, there is broad diversity and variation in health status, access to care, and health outcomes. 

This repository was compiled for our final project in BST 260. 

## Data Sources:
For this project, we used the following data sources:
[US county health rankings](https://www.rwjf.org/en/how-we-work/grants-explorer/featured-programs/county-health-ranking-roadmap.html)  
[US county-level mortality data](https://www.kaggle.com/IHME/us-countylevel-mortality)
