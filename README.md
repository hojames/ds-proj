# Understanding Recent Life Expectancy Declines in the United States through Exploratory Data Analysis and Principal Component Analysis 

## Motivation
We are interested in exploring domestic health policy through the lens of county-level health rankings, mortality data, and other relevant determinants of health. Across the United States, there is broad diversity and variation in health status, access to care, and health outcomes. We are curious about the decline of life expectancy in the US (for the first time since the 1990s), and which groups of people (by location, race, income level, or other factors) experienced different changes in mortality and by what cause of death. This analysis could provide insights that could guide targeted health interventions for specific communities in the US.
