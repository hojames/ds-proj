### Overview

### Related Work
As we embarked on this project, we found that we weren't the only ones interested in exploring disparities in life expectancy/determinants of health at the county level. Some previous work that helped to guide our project development is below:
- [35 Years of Death, via 538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/mortality-rates-united-states/)
- [Article Summarizing New Findings, via 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-die-may-depend-on-where-they-live/)

Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.

Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.

Initial Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.

Exploratory Analysis: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?

Final Analysis: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answer
